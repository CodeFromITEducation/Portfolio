# Portfolio
This Repository is dedicated to a project I'm creating for employers.
The Purpose of this project is to showcase more about my expertise 
here in the field of software development. Each page is dedicated to a 
certain programming language and what I've learned. 
What that learning entails is some programming terminology as well as some
of the programs I've written putting context into it. These programs can include
projects simple assignments I did in college to some things I've done in my free time.
You will know how it happened the situation I did it in as well as what purpose 
the program serves.
