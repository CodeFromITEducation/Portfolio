      <p>This concludes the C# terminology table. Moving forward we have documentation on my DB2Crud<br>
        project I created on a cloudserver using the deathstar.gtc.edu database provided by my college.<br>
        This program does not show a end result as I do not have access to the database anymore.</p>

        <img src="~/Images/DatagridForm.png">
        <button class="collapsible">Click here for code explanation</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p> This image presents what I like to call the datagrid. The datagrid is used to carry out all<br>
      CRUD operations. These include Create, Read, Update, and Delete for a database.</p>
      <br /><img src='~/Images/GridCode.PNG'>

      <p>This is the code behind the datagrid. Within the first line of code you will notice a binding<br>
      source. The binding source is used to establish a connection to a database. The database in this<br>
      example is named deathstar.gtc.edu. The reason this works is because the database establishes a<br>  
      connection to the deathstar database within the cloudserver. Moving on we have the data adapter.<br>
      The data adapter is used to specify what you are doing inside of the database. So in other words <br>
      the data adapter is a tool used to specify what SQL command is being carried out. The next 2 strings<br>
      are used to make the code look neater. The strings hold the datasource and the sql needed to access<br>
      the club member table from inside the deathstar. The data adapter needs to access the table which<br>
      is why the 2 strings come in. The command builder is needed to make commands function properly <br>
      from inside the program. It is the reason the sql string functions properly. Next you see a table.<br>
      This table is used to fill in the data adapter on what the sql string is trying to do. <br>
      Plus it is used to provide the instance of data to the binding source.</p>

      <div class="content">
      <p>
        These last 2 areas of code serve to update the table after a Crud operation is carried out.<br> 
        Also to catch any errors you may encounter in the coding process. Errors display in the textbox.<br>
        Moving forward next we have all 4 CRUD operations. <br>
      </p>
      </div>
      <img src="~/Images/CrudForm.PNG">
      <button class="collapsible">Click here for code explanation</button>
      <div class="content">
      <p> What we have here is a form dedicated to 3 of cruds operations. Each button you push<br>
        in this program will carry out the operation it is labeled as. whether it be create read update or delete.<br>
        Just to not get confused read is display. This application will do all of them. Moving on from the form there <br>
        is the code that carry's out these tasks behind it.
      </p>
      </div>
      <img src="~/Images/b1dsp.PNG">
      <button class="collapsible">Click here for code explanation</button>
      <div class="content">
      <p>Button 1 as the code defines it is the read button. the first line of code is the SQL string this is used<br>
      to carry out the read operation via SQL commands. The next line of code is conn short for connection. Conn is<br> 
      self explanatory. Basically it just establishes connection with the datagrid I explained before. Once connection <br>
      is established the code conveys a sql command. You can't convey this earlier otherwise it will break the program. <br>
      This is why it is important to understand scope. Scope determines the range of accessibility. Because the SQL is <br>
      inside the button click event. Interference will never happen on account of command alteration. Back to the SQL<br>
      command this command in particular will display all the information in the table. Here the table is BOAT_TYPE2.<br>
      The select statement as well as the * means select all. So it is selecting all the information in the table.<br>
      Next the adapter basically establishes the connection and the command to convey it to the compiler. Then the<br>
      adapter fills itself with information via the dataset. Lastly the dataset prints itself out inside the listbox.<br>
      The listbox first clears itself before that happens to keep things neat and organized. This concludes the read<br>
      operation.      
    </p>
    </div><br>
     <img src="~/Images/b2ist.PNG">
     <button class="collapsible">Click here for code explanation</button>
     <div class="content">
     <p>Button 2 as the code defines it is the create button. Starting out the lines of code we have the cmdtext.<br>
      The cmdtext is used to convey the values that are being altered inside the database. Here in this event we<br>
      are adding values to ID Length and description parameters. The at symbol type is used to find the data type each of <br>
      those values uses. Here the ID and length are integers. Lastly description is a string. After creating cmdtext<br>
      we make an IDB2 command. the way we do this is by using conn and cmdtext. Next we use the built in method of<br>
      derive parameters. This makes it so we can add data into the table's parameters. After this in the next 3 <br>
      lines is where we input the values into the parameters. This code basically adds in a id description and length<br>
      in the table BOAT_TYPE2.   
     </p>
     </div>
     <img src="~/Images/b3upd.PNG">
     <button class="collapsible">Click here for code explanation</button>
     <div class="content">
     <p>
      Button 3 as the code defines it is the update button. The update button is used to both edit and save data in the<br> 
      BOAT_TYPE2 table. Update serves as a confirmation in the sql table as well as a way to make changes. Here in this<br>
      button event you can see that we are changing boat length using the where modifier. Where is used to separate all<br>
      of the data so that you can target a specific point. Without where we would be changing the length of every single<br>
      entry of length recorded in the boat type 2 table. In Basic terms it would make all boats look like they have the<br>
      same length when they don't.  </p></div><br><br>
      <img src="~/Images/b4del.PNG">
      <button class="collapsible">Click here for code explanation</button>
      <div class="content">
      <p>
         Button 4 as the code defines it is the delete button. As always we have our first line the cmdText.<br>
         The CMD text calls the delete command specifying the BOAT_TYPE2 table. Also specifying the ID.<br>
         Basically what this code will do is it will delete the data I inserted originally. The where is<br> 
         specified to be the TYPE_ID. The TYPE_ID inserted in this case is 13 if you can recall the type ID.<br>
         On the data I inserted is 13. Basically this program you could add and delete the record repeatedly.
      </p></div><br>

      <p>For a second project I have a Windows Forms Application that uses a SQLITE database to manage a diary.<br>
         This windows forms application also runs the output of a console application to manage the Edits and<br>
         deletes. You can see how the program functions via the buttons below if you cloned this off github<br>
         here are the associated files you need to make this work.      
      </p>

        @using (Html.BeginForm("Diary", "Home", FormMethod.Post))
        {
        <input type="submit" value="Run Diary App" />
        }
      <p>
          As you can see from the video we have a program that uses CRUD to manage a diary. Not <br>
          only that we have a console application attached to the same program that presents a<br>
          alternate way to handle the edits and deletes via a button click event. Moving on from <br>
          the showcase of the output we have the code explained via images once again.</p>

          These first few lines of code establish 2 things. The first thing is the kernel.dll. This ties <br>
          in to the console output that you see. What the kernel.dll is doing is giving access to AllocConsole<br>
          AllocConsole is creating a console application for me whenever I click the Console button shown<br> 
          in the output above. This is the first step in combining a console application with a WFA.<br> 
          After AllocConsole is where we declare the SQLite connection variable. Basically this variable<br>
          pulls from a separate program that I created a database to manage quotes. This variable takes the<br>
          database from the absolute file path. Continuing to CreateDiaryTable. This method creates the table inside<br>
          of QuoteData. Which is done via the create table command. The table holds 2 variables EntryID and Entry.<br>
          EntryID serves as the pages which is handled in the single line textbox from the output of the form or<br>
          if you are using the console application it is handled by Console.Readline() and user input.<br>
